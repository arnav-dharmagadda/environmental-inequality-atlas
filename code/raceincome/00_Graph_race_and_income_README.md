# Purpose

This script produces visualizations that show how race and income interact with eachother. the input is the cleaned race-income gridded EIF data and the output is 6 visualizations. 

First, the script filters for data from the year 2023. Then, it creates a number of visualizations that do the following: 
1. Creates a bar graph that shows income decile distribution for each race
2. Creates separate bar graphs for each race that shows the income decile distribution
3. Create a graph that has one bar for each race and different colors represent the income decile distribution
4. Groups the income deciles into three categories (low, mid, high) and creates a bar graph the shows the distribution of each category for each race
5. Creates a bar graph that shows the proportional grouped income distribution for each race
6. Creates a bar graph graph that shows the share of each race group in the 1st, 5th, and 10th decile

# Instructions
1. Run the setup code to prepare the inputs
2. Run the script
