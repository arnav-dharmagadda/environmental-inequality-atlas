Created: 6/3/2025

# Purpose

This script creates graphs that visualize the race data from 2023 in Charlottesville. It creates two graphs which serve as a template for race based visualizations. 

First, the script takes the race_income file and filters for 2023. Then it creates a variable which calculates the total amount of black people in Charlottesville. 

From there, the script produces the output of two graphs. The first one delivers an output of a gridded map of Charlottesville which displays the count of Black residents in each grid. The second one delivers an output of the percent of Black people living in each grid compared with the population of Charlottesville. Both of these maps could be edited to show the population of different races. 

# Instructions

1. Run the setup code to set the working directory and bring the data in
2. Run the code and the two graph will be saved into the Outputs folder
3. Edit the code if necessary to reflect other races
