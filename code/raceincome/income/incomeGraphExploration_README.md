# Purpose

This script creates visualizations using the EIF income data. It has an input of the cleaned race-income data and outputs 6 visualizations relating to income. 

First, the script filters the data for the year 2023 and shapes the data into a gridded visualization. The graphs it produces are the following: 
1. A map that shows the population count of people in the tenth income decile per grid
2. A map that shows the population count of people in the first income decile per grid
3. A map that shows the population count of people in the 1st-3rd income deciles per grid
4. A map that shows the population count of people in the 8th-10th income deciles per grid
5. A map that shows the percent of people in the 1st-3rd income deciles per grid
6. A map that shows the share of people in the 1st-3rd income deciles per grid

# Instruction

1. Run the setup code to prepare the inputs
2. Run the script
3. If needed, edit the code to create visualizations that represent different aspects of income visualizations
